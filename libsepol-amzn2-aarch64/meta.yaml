  summary: "(CDT) SELinux binary policy manipulation library"
  description: |
        Security-enhanced Linux is a feature of the Linux® kernel and a number of
        utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory
        access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new
        architectural components originally developed to improve the security of the
        Flask operating system. These architectural components provide general support
        for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access control policies,
        including those based on the concepts of Type Enforcement®, Role-based Access
        Control, and Multi-level Security.  libsepol provides an API for the
        manipulation of SELinux binary policies. It is used by checkpolicy (the policy
        compiler) and similar tools, as well as by programs like load_policy that need
        to perform specific transformations on binary policies such as customizing
        policy boolean settings.
